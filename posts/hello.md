For the longest time, I've been a [dark matter developer](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/dark-matter-developers-the-unseen-99) and this blog is my attempt to change that. You will mostly find content relevant to programming and system design.

At times, this might be code samples or my experiences with technology. It's a personal space to share my opinions, thoughts and ideas focused on programming. I hope to contribute something worthwhile to largely crowded space of this big old internet.
