Hi, I am {{ metadata.author.name }}.

From 2014 to 2019, I helped [Ellie Mae](https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/) or [ICE Mortgage Technology](https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/) design and build [LO Connect](https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/encompass/encompass-lo-connect), a tool for Loan Officers to manage loan applications through the mortgage lending process and [Consumer Connect](https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/solutions/consumer-engagement/encompass-consumer-connect), a tool for borrowers to digitally connect to their loan application.

Before that, I helped [Verio](https://www.verio.com/) with their Control Panel and VPS Hosting Platform and even before that, I briefly helped [Brandify](https://www.brandify.com/) with their Localization and mapping solution that powers the [Store Locator](https://www.thenorthface.com/utility/store-locator.html) for [The North Face](https://www.thenorthface.com/)

I spent quite some time consulting with [Deutsche Bank](https://www.db.com/) to manage their JMS MQ Infrastructure and helped [Chicago Board of Options Exchange](https://www.cboe.com/) with JVM performance tuning for the Exchange Platform and a bunch of other stuff.

I primarily speak Javascript, Python and Go with much of my work hidden behind corporate firewalls. However, I recently started releasing few projects on my github. Notably:

- [klap](https://github.com/osdevisnot/klap): a zero config, zero dependency bundler for tiny javascript packages
- [sorvor](https://github.com/osdevisnot/sorvor): an extremely fast, zero config server for modern web applications.

To keep updated with my work, follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/osdevisnot) or [Github](https://github.com/osdevisnot) or subscribe to this blog with [RSS]({{ metadata.feed.path }}) or [JSON]({{ metadata.jsonfeed.path }}) feed.
